# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Group Guard For VRChat ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

We prioritize your privacy and minimize data collection. We categorize our data collection into **Anonymous Telemetry** (collected for all users) and **Account Data** (collected only if you log in or use Cloud features).

### A. Anonymous Telemetry (General Usage)

To understand how many people use our software and to check for updates, we collect:

- **Installation UUID:** A randomly generated unique identifier stored locally on your device. This allows us to count unique active users without knowing who you are.
- **App Version:** The version of the software you are running.
- **Activity Timestamps:** When your client sends a strict "heartbeat" signal to our server.

**We DO NOT log your IP address** for tracking purposes.
**We DO NOT collect your VRChat Identity** or hardware fingerprints (HWID) for general telemetry.

### B. Registered Account Data (Optional)

If you choose to link your VRChat account to use Cloud Features (e.g., Global Blocklists, User Reports, Cloud Settings), we collect:

- **VRChat User ID & Display Name:** To identify you and sync your settings across devices.
- **Trust Score / Reputation:** Internal metrics based on your verified reports and community standing.
- **Report History:** Data regarding reports you submit (Target ID, Reason) to enforce community safety.

### C. Administrator Data (Service Operators)

If you are an Administrator hosting or managing a Group Guard instance:

- **Username & Password:** Hashed securely.
- **Installation UUID:** Used as a hardware lock to secure your admin account preventing unauthorized access from new devices.

## 2. Local Data Processing

Most features of Group Guard process data **locally on your computer**:

- **VRChat Logs:** Scanned in real-time on your PC to detect join/leave events. This log data is processed locally and is NOT uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly submit a specific report.
- **Configuration:** Your settings are stored locally (`group-guard-credentials.json`, `config.json`).

## 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Security:** To detect bot nets, spam, and malicious use of the Cloud API.
- **Development:** To track total user count and active versions.
- **Functionality:** To allow you to sync your blocklists and settings (if logged in).

## 4. Data Sharing

- **Third Parties:** We do **NOT** sell, trade, or transfer your data to outside parties.
- **VRChat Inc:** We are not affiliated with VRChat Inc. We do not share data with them unless required by law or to report severe TOS violations (e.g. illegal content).

## 5. Data Deletion (GDPR)

You have the right to request deletion of your data.

- **Telemetry:** You can reset your potentially identifying Installation UUID in the settings, effectively "forgetting" your previous history.
- **Cloud Account:** You may request full account deletion via the application or our support channels.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. Continued use of the Software after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
